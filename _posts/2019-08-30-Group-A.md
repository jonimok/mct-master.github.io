We are a very diverse group, with backgrounds ranging from graphic design to electrical engineering. This complementary has been felt since we first met, and it helps us considering many different points of view for a same problem. Our collaboration is fruitful, and this is especially because it seems like everyone is open to each other, and to any new input. We all realised that our differences were our strength. Moreover, we don’t hesitate to question ideas, discuss and review them in a very constructive way. We are glad to work together!

# Gaute Wardenær

Live sound engineer at heart, but very eclectic in interests. Started at a young age putting crazy ideas to life by taking technology apart and trying to make it work in different ways, still considers himself as an inventor/entrepreneur more than a sound engineer. The most exciting thing is learning new things to expand the understanding of how the world works; technology, psychology, sociology, philosophy, biology...

# Thibault Jaccard

Thibault started classical violin at the age of 6. He never stopped discovering new instruments and musical horizons since. While he was studying electrical engineering, he started playing gipsy jazz in [Gipsy Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/gipsytonic), and managed to do it as a living. By exploring complex harmony, he begun to design music theory user interfaces, which brought him to this very master degree.

Ulrik has always been very interested in music, initially as a listener but then he also got into organizing concerts, DJ-ing and small-time music production. His educational background is from computer science, so MCT was a way of combining his interests in the intersection of technology and arts.
