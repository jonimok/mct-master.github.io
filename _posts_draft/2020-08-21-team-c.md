## Say hello to MTC Team C 2020!

We are a diverse group of people, with members originating from France, Singapore, United States and Norway. Our background stems from different fields of the music industry. Music performance, music technology, musicology, sound design, spatial audio, acousmatic composition and music recording are amongst our expertise fields. We are all eager to get started with the hard work, and hopefully, change the world as technological humanists.

## Stephen

Stephen is a programmer and musician from Wales in the UK. He plays bass - both the guitar and the giant violin shaped one, and loves to spend evenings tucked away in his studio, getting lost in a haze of swirling, synthesised dreaminess. He is a [business owner](https://www.noddlepod.com), and has spent over half his life living in other peoples countries. He also loves writing stories about underwater animals for his seven year old son, and has spent several years teaching SCUBA diving in south east Asia. The MCT programme looks like it's going to be a gigantic playground for Stephen - there is so much of interest that he isn't quite sure of where to start. But it will probably involve building things, exploring new ways of performing live electronic music, and absorbing all that he can about communication, learning and pedagogy, as being a teacher is ultimately what he wants to do with his life.

## Joni

Joni is a User Experience Designer and a Classical Flautist with a strong interest in neurology and psychiatry. She has a passion for finding solutions to wicked problems, such as finding ways to enhance the learning experience for cognitively 'not-so-fluent' people. She believes everyone can learn and create amazing things that we only need to find different methods. Joining the MCT programme, she wants to explore the possibilities and limitations of how music can create impact through the screens. Her research areas include HCI, Interface, User-Centred Design, Universal Design, Inclusive Design, Cognitive Psychology - Attention and Memory, Epistemology, Mental Health and Neuro-Musicology.
